# Available rule types:
# 1. :buy_one_get_one_free
#    Format: {product_code, :buy_one_get_one_free}
#    Description: Customer gets two items for the price of one.
#
# 2. {:bulk_discount, min_quantity, discounted_price}
#    Format: {product_code, {:bulk_discount, min_quantity, discounted_price}}
#    Description: When buying min_quantity or more, each item costs discounted_price.
#    Note: discounted_price is a string representation of a decimal number.
#
# 3. {:bulk_discount_percentage, min_quantity, discount_factor}
#    Format: {product_code, {:bulk_discount_percentage, min_quantity, discount_factor}}
#    Description: When buying min_quantity or more, price is reduced by discount_factor.
#    Note: discount_factor is a string representation of a decimal number (e.g., "0.6667" for 33.33% discount).
